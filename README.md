👋 Good morning, afternoon or evening. I am MatGendron. <br>
🤖 I am currently employed as a backend developer for projects around AI by a multinational corporation. <br>
👨‍💻 I am mainly using python as part of my work but I have dabbled in a lot of different languages in the past, C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, to name a few. <br>
🎮 My hobbyist projects, if I dare get to it, would most likely be about game development.
